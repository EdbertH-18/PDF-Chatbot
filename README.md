# ðŸ§  RAG Chatbot â€“ HR Assistant Powered by PDF

A chatbot that serves as an HR assistant.  
It helps HR teams answer various questions from employees about company-related topics  
by extracting information from uploaded PDFs, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The model reads your document, picks the most relevant part, and responds like a friendly admin on WhatsApp.  
No hallucination, no guessing â€” it only answers based on whatâ€™s actually written in the file.

## ðŸ“„ Recommended PDF Structure

To get the best results, use a clean, readable company document such as:

- Company Handbook  
- HR Policy Guidelines  
- Employee Onboarding PDF

Make sure the content inside the PDF is **text-based** (not image-scanned), and each section uses clear wording.  
Long, well-separated paragraphs work best for chunking and understanding.
